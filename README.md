# WALL E
Wall-E is about the future of earth, learning about techlogies while they fully rely on robots, Wall-E was one of those robots.
Wall-E isn't a name for a specific robot, it is a name for robots of his kind, but he was the only relevant Wall E because for 700 years was the only Wall-E that survived, while the humans left earth to live in space.

The reason why Wall-E met Eve is because Eve had a mission to search for life of plants, she needed to bring it to space so that they can confirm that the earth's ecosystem have healed, but the robot was frustrated because she can't see any plant/plants, but then he met Wall-E then they had fun together, but then Wall-E showed Eve the plant, she was surprised and stored it in her compartment then had like a powersaving mode where she wouldn't move or do anything.

in summary the OTTO(the steering wheel robot)was preventing humans to go back to earth because it was programmed to keep humans in space and if ever they say a life of plants the OTTO will just throw it away.

Wall-E and Eve tried to bring back the plant because OTTO threw it away, Wall-E sacrificed his life in order to bring the humans back to earth, but it was okay because when Eve and Wall-E got back to earth Eve went directly to Wall-E's place and searched for spare parts to replace his damaged parts, luckily Wall-E was alive.
