# WALL E
Wall-E is about the future of earth, learning about techlogies while they fully rely on robots, Wall-E was one of those robots.
Wall-E isn't a name for a specific robot, it is a name for robots of his kind, but he was the only relevant Wall E because for 700 years he survived and was the only Wall-E that survived
